# Contributing

Code contributions are actively encouraged, either via issues (reporting a bug) or pull requests (contributing code).
Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your contributions to this project.

## Bugs & issues
When reporting a bug, we value the extra time you take to include details such as:
 - What version of mario that you are using
 - Steps to reproduce *before* the bug occurred
 - A reproducable example (this helps us form a test case)
 - Environment/configuration that is relevant to your bug.

## Pull Requests

1. First create an issue to discuss the feature you wish to implement.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
3. If modifying the CLI or exposing new features, ensure the README.md is updated with your new feature. This includes environment variables or dependencies or optional arguments etc. In short "Anything a user needs to know about this feature".
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. Ensure the both tests and linting pass. We may additionally request changes be made as part of the review.
